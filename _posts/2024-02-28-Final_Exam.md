# Final Blog

## Pokemort Game
The first trimester my group of 4 created a basic gameabout exploring the world and talking to the teacher NPC (Mr Mort). This was a challenege for us because we have never learned how to code before so we had to use the reasources that we were provided with. In the end I think it turned out pretty well.

## Snake Game
The snake game was a fairly simple where we were given the code and we had to modiy some bit of it. I decided to modify the snake color and the dot that the snake eat. This game was simple yet intriging and it is also in my blog

## Level Four in the Mario Game
The level four in the mario game is a personal addition of what we want to add into the game. I decided to base it off of a show called "family guy" because I think it is a funny idea. Some of the things that I added are
- A new sprite to change the character
- New Goombas based on one of the enemies in the chow
- Changed the tubeinto one of the main characters favorite spots
- And the platforms into the characters favorite food.
