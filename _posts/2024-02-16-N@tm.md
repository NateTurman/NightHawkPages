# What I Showed at N@tm
- During N@tm I went over the basic elements of our code and what it does
- I showed things like the leaderboard, timer, moving background, walls, different characters, goombas, the lucky block, and multiplayer
- I let the people play the game and explore different features within the game
- Once I had enough people I showed them other people that are playing on the same server and even opened the chat

# What I Saw
- I saw a game where you make some food which was very interesting because there was a lot of animations and thought that went in to the creation of the game
- The next game that I saw was a cookbook game where you search up a food that you want to make and it shows you all the ingrediants and instructions. It also shows you the nearest reastraunts that have that food by using and API.
