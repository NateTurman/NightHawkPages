        <h1>Basic Steps of Animation</h1>
        <p>
            Below is a sprite of Mr. Lopez. This was the first sprite created for his spritesheet, which outlines the animation of his movement frame by frame.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/gameimages/1_lopez.png" alt="1_lopez" style="height: 138px; width: 156px">
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Below is the spritesheet of Mr. Lopez. Each row has a different side of him, because in the project that we used this in, he was able to move freely in all 4 directions. His animation is simple, and depicts basic movement. 
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>

        <p>
        The most recent changes made to the spritesheet was the addition of his cane. In our OOP game, we plan to have the player utilize Mr. Lopez's cane as a weapon. Our next step in animation will be drawing new sprites for the player's attacks.

        <h1>Additions to Game Levels</h1>
            <p>
            Adding new animations gives the player new capabilities. For example, drawing attacking sprites will give the game a new feature by allowing the player to attack enemies. If there are not sprites for enemies taking damage, this will require more work to be put towards drawing damage-taking sprites.
            </p>

        <h1>Involvement in Code</h1>
            <p>
                The code is very easy to modify with new animations. The biggest change would be the addition of a keybind that is linked to the new rows for attack animations, but this can easily be copy-pasted in the Player.js file. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, below is a part of the Player.js file that deals with keybinds and frames. The addition of the "e" will be linked to the new frames of animation. 
            <p>
            <p>
                w: { row: 3, frames: 4, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } }, // Lopez faces away from user
                    <br><br>
	            a: { row: 1, frames: 4, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } }, // Walk left key
                    <br><br>
                    s: { }, // no action
                    <br><br>
	            d: { row: 2, frames: 4, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } }, // Walk right key
                    <br><br>
                e: { row: _, frames: 4, idleFrame: { column: 1, frames: 0 } }, // Animation for attack
            </p>
